# Predicting Student Depression Risk Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Description
This project develops a supervised machine learning model to **predict depression risk among students** using the Student Depression Dataset. The study applies classification models and interpretability techniques to identify key risk factors contributing to mental health vulnerability in educational settings.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle: Student Depression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-depression-dataset/data). It contains 27,901 student records with 18 features, including demographic information, academic indicators, and mental health-related variables.

## Project Objectives
1. Train and evaluate supervised classification models to estimate depression risk.
2. Apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions.
3. Identify the most significant risk factors associated with student depression.
