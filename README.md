# Coding Camp Projects Portfolio
This repository includes a collection of final projects completed in the Coding Camp 2025 program, each focusing on practical implementation of data analysis, statistical modeling, and analytical reasoning in diverse case studies. Each project demonstrates a different analytical approach and application domain, ranging from business analytics to social impact and personalized systems.

## 1. Interactive Dashboard for Analyzing Bike Sharing Demand Trends 
An **interactive time-based dashboard** analyzing how weather conditions, seasonal patterns, and temporal factors influence bike rental demand. The project highlights trend exploration and data-driven insights for operational planning.

## 2. Bank Transaction Analysis Using Clustering and Pseudo-Label Classification
A two-stage machine learning approach that **combines unsupervised clustering with supervised classification** to analyzes bank transaction data. This project demonstrates how unlabeled transaction data can be transformed into structured categories for predictive modeling.

## 3. Canva User Review Sentiment Analysis Using NLP
A **sentiment classification** project that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to Canva user reviews. The analysis converts unstructured text into structured insights for understanding customer perception.

## 4. Flower Image Classification Using Transfer Learning (MobileNet)
This project implements an **image classification model** to categorize flower images using a **transfer learning** approach. The selected model achieved a test accuracy of 91.16%, demonstrating strong generalization performance on unseen data while maintaining computational efficiency.

## 5. Predicting Student Depression Risk Using Supervised Machine Learning
A supervised learning project focused on **identifying mental health risk factors** among students. Model interpretability techniques (SHAP) are used to explain prediction drivers and highlight significant contributing variables. The model is intended for analytical and research purposes rather than clinical diagnosis.

## 6. Movie Recommendation System Using Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering
This project implements a **movie recommendation system** using two fundamental approaches: **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering**. Each method was developed and evaluated independently to compare their recommendation behavior.

## Technical Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, SHAP, NLP libraries, and data visualization tools.
