# Movie Recommendation System Using Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering

## Description
This project implements a **movie recommendation system** using two independent approaches: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The objective is to generate personalized movie recommendations based on either item similarity or user interaction patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [Kaggle: Movies & Ratings for Recommendation System](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicoletacilibiu/movies-and-ratings-for-recommendation-system).The dataset consists of two files, movies.csv containing movie metadata and ratings.csv containing user–movie rating interactions.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a content-based filtering model using movie features.
2. Develop a collaborative filtering model based on user–item interactions.
3. Compare recommendation behavior and performance between the two approaches
