# Bank Transaction Analysis Using Clustering and Pseudo-Label Classification

## Description
This project applies a **two-stage machine learning approach** to analyze bank transaction data. First, clustering techniques are used to identify behavioral patterns and segment transactions. The resulting clusters are then treated as **pseudo-labels** to train supervised classification models.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of bank transaction records containing financial and behavioral features used to identify transaction patterns and customer segments. It can be downloaded from [Kaggle: Bank Transaction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection).

## Project Objectives
1. Perform clustering to discover underlying transaction patterns.
2. Transform cluster outputs into pseudo-labels for supervised learning.
3. Train and evaluate classification models to predict transaction segments automatically.
